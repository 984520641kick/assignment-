Abstract: In the last years, job recommender systems have become popular since
they successfully reduce information overload by generating personalized job suggestions. Although in the literature exists a variety of techniques and strategies used as part of job recommender systems, most
of them fail to recommending job vacancies that fit properly to the job
seekers profiles. Thus, the contributions of this work are threefold, we:
i) made publicly available a new dataset formed by a set of job seekers
profiles and a set of job vacancies collected from different job search
engine sites; ii) put forward the proposal of a framework for job recommendation based on professional skills of job seekers; and iii) carried
out an evaluation to quantify empirically the recommendation abilities
of two state-of-the-art methods, considering different configurations,
within the proposed framework. We thus present a general panorama
of job recommendation task aiming to facilitate research and real-world
application design regarding this important issue.
Keywords: Job matching, job seeking, job search, job recommender recommendation has traditionally 
been treated as a filter-based match or as a 
recommendation based on the features of 
jobs and candidates as discrete entities. In 
this paper, we introduce a methodology 
where we leverage the progression of job 
selection by candidates using machine 
learning. Additionally, our 
recommendation is composed of several 
other sub-recommendations that contribute 
to at least one of a) making 
recommendations serendipitous for the 
end user b) overcoming cold-start for both 
candidates and jobs. One of the unique 
selling propositions of our methodology is 
the way we have used skills as embedded 
features and derived latent competencies 
from them, thereby attempting to expand 
the skills of candidates and jobs to achieve 
more coverage in the skill domain. We 
have deployed our model in a real-world 
job recommender system and have 
achieved the best click-through rate 
through a blended approach of machinelearned recommendations and other subrecommendations. For recommending jobs 
through machine learning that forms a 
significant part of our recommendation, 
we achieve the best results through
